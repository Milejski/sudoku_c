# sudoku_c
Simple sudoku game written in c.

Works only on windows due to the way function getch() is implemented (requires windows.h).

The program stores user data (control scheme, color options and sudoku database) in data.txt file. New data.txt is created during start up, if no such file exist in current directory.
